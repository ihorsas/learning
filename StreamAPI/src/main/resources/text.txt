Certainly! Here are some slightly more challenging tasks that will help you further explore and deepen your understanding of the Stream API:

Task: Given a list of integers, write a program to find the average of the squares of even numbers.

Requirements:
Use the Stream API to filter out the even numbers.
Square each even number.
Calculate the average of the squared even numbers.
Test your program with different input lists of integers.
Task: Implement a program that reads a text file and counts the occurrences of each word, ignoring case sensitivity and punctuation.

Requirements:
Use the Stream API to read the file, split the text into words, and count their occurrences.
Remove punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, question marks) from the words.
Ignore case sensitivity while counting occurrences.
Display the word count for each unique word.
Test your program with different text files.
Task: Given a list of strings, write a program to group the strings by their lengths into a Map.

Requirements:
Use the Stream API to group the strings based on their lengths.
Create a Map where the keys represent the string lengths and the values are lists of strings with the corresponding lengths.
Test your program with different input lists of strings.
Task: Develop a program that finds the two longest words from a list of strings, using the Stream API.

Requirements:
Use the Stream API to find the two longest words in the list.
Handle cases where there are multiple words with the same maximum length.
Display the two longest words.
Test your program with different input lists of strings.
These tasks will challenge you to utilize different methods of the Stream API, such as filtering, mapping, reducing, and grouping. Remember to break down the tasks into smaller steps, and test your programs with various inputs to ensure their correctness and efficiency. Good luck!
