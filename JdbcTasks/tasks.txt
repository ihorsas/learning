Task: Develop a simple Java application that interacts with a database using JDBC.
Requirements:
Create a database table (e.g., "Employee") with relevant fields (e.g., "id," "name," "salary").
Implement Java classes to represent the table structure (e.g., "Employee" class).
Write methods to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database using JDBC.
Test your application by inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting records from the database.
